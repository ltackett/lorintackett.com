## Front-End Developer Portfolio of Lorin Tackett

I started poking around with the internet in the 90s. It was a lot easier to learn by example back then. You could view the source code of a web page and most of the time it was pretty easy to read through it to see what does what.

These days it's a lot harder. The landscape of developer options a lot more saturated When viewing the code it's often concatenated, minified, and difficult to read through without comments.

There was a time when I considered my source code to be a closely-guarded secret. This was a mistake. I was a beginner. Nothing I was doing was game-changing... and even if it were, it should always be shared.

This is a repository my current portfolio, and as many of my past portfolios as I could find.

There will be one branch per portfolio, with the naming convention `portfolio-[year]-[month]`.
