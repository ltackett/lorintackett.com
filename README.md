## Personal website for Lorin Tackett

### Open Source Software

I started poking around with code in the 90s. It was a lot easier to learn by example back then. You could view the source code of any web page and most of the time it was pretty easy to read through it to figure out what does what.

These days it's a lot harder. The landscape of developer options a lot more saturated When viewing the code it's often concatenated, minified, and difficult to read through.

The goal of this repository is to make it easier to find and read through the code that powers my personal website and past versions that have been hosted at lorintackett.com over the years.
