## Front-End Developer Portfolio of Lorin Tackett

### May, 2014

I decided to give Bootstrap a proper go. I've had a couple bad experiences with Bootstrap on client projects Even though I vastly prefer other grid/UI libraries, it is always good to get some perspective.


This iteration of my portfolio was inspired in part by a Bootstrap expo piece: [Portfolio of Nick DiMatteo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/2014/03/07/nick-dimatteo/). I liked the way each portfolio item had an accompanying background color.

Most of my past portfolios have lacked texture, and I admit I'm not a huge fan of it myself. In spite of this, I chose to grab some free textures off of [DeviantArt](http://deviantart.com) and [WebTreats](http://backgrounds.mysitemyway.com/) to add a little more flavor to each slide. For each texture I made high-contrast grayscale versions, and keyed out the black or white, depending on which slide I intended to use it on. This way I can change the colors in the future, or re-use the patterns on other elements.

If you want to explore this version of my portfolio, you will need to familiarize yourself with these libraries and languages:

* `skrollr`
* `jquery`
* `bootstrap`
* `middleman`
* `haml`
* `sass`
* `coffeescript`

### Open Source Software

I started poking around with the internet in the 90s. It was a lot easier to learn by example back then. You could view the source code of a web page and most of the time it was pretty easy to read through it to see what does what.

These days it's a lot harder. The landscape of developer options a lot more saturated When viewing the code it's often concatenated, minified, and difficult to read through without comments.

There was a time when I considered my source code to be a closely-guarded secret. This was a mistake. I was a beginner. Nothing I was doing was game-changing... and even if it were, it should always be shared.

This is a repository my current portfolio, and as many of my past portfolios as I could find.

There will be one branch per portfolio, with the naming convention `portfolio-[year]-[month]`.
