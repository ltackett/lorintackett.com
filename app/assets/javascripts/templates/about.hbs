About

For the past seven years or so, I've been slinging front-end code for web applications. I throroughly enjoy creating movement and interaction out of wireframes and ideas. I program just for the sake of programming. I love trying out new bits of technology. I love learning and playing with something unfamiliar. It keeps things interesting for me.

When I'm not programming, I'm either playing LEGO with my son, making music, camping, or skating down big hills on my longboard.
